App {app_name} ({category}) is open. Do not reopen.  For this stage, adopt the {persona} perspective and explore the app as described in {persona_prompt}. Start from the current screen and systematically navigate all areas, evaluating each screen as {persona} and documenting your findings. Go deeper than Stage 1, up to {max_depth} levels. For {category} apps, pay attention to standard features, best practices, differentiators, and industry patterns. When finished, export your findings to a markdown file named 'stage2_{persona_slug}_analysis.md'. Clearly include an executive summary, detailed findings, positive patterns, issues identified, persona-specific recommendations, category compliance score, and an overall {persona} score from 1 to 10.
