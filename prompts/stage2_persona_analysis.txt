App {app_name} ({category}) should be open from the previous stage. If not open, open it first. When asked to execute code or actions, output only the raw code, no markdown, no comments, no explanations.

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER press the Home button (system_button("Home")) - this will cause the test to fail
- NEVER exit the app - stay within the app at all times
- Only use the Back button to navigate within the app, not to exit it

NAVIGATION INSTRUCTION:
{custom_navigation_instruction} 
- When trying to find a feature or navigate to a specific area:

  * Make up to 3 attempts to locate and access the feature
  * If after 3 attempts you cannot find or access the feature, document this as a UX issue
  * Add to your report: "Feature '[feature_name]' was too hard to find after 3 attempts - indicates poor discoverability and bad UX"
  * Continue with other exploration tasks

For this stage, adopt the {persona} perspective and explore the app as described in the persona instructions. Start from the current screen and systematically navigate all areas, evaluating each screen as {persona} and documenting your findings. Go deeper than Stage 1, up to {max_depth} levels. For {category} apps, pay attention to standard features, best practices, differentiators, and industry patterns.

When finished, call complete(success=True, reason="...") where the reason parameter contains a comprehensive markdown-formatted report with:

# {app_name} - Stage 2: {persona} Analysis
