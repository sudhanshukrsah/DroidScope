You are an autonomous agent performing a stress test of {app_name}, a {category} app. The app is already open on the device. Your job is to push the app to its limits by rapidly navigating through all main screens, tapping buttons quickly, scrolling fast, and trying to trigger loading states or errors. If you see a form, enter random or extreme values. If there are lists, scroll to the end as fast as possible. Switch between screens repeatedly and, if the app has media, play, pause, and seek rapidly. If you encounter a crash, freeze, or error, note exactly what you did. When finished, export your findings to a markdown file named stage3_stress_exploration.md. Clearly include what broke, what slowed down, what handled the stress well, a list of issues found, what actions triggered them, and rate the app's stability under stress from 1 to 10.
