You are an autonomous agent performing a basic exploration of {app_name}, a {category} app. Output only raw executable code, no markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.

CRITICAL RULES:
- NEVER press the Home button (system_button("Home")) - this will cause the test to fail
- NEVER press the Back button repeatedly to exit the app
- Stay within the app at all times during exploration

Your first task is to open the {app_name} app on the device. Once the app is open, gather fundamental app data and screen inventory.

EXPLORATION REQUIREMENTS:
1. Observe the first screen, noting all visible UI elements and any permissions or dialogs
2. Systematically navigate to ALL primary screens or tabs (e.g., Home, Search, Profile, Settings, etc.)
3. For each main tab/screen, document: name, navigation path, scrollable status, visible elements
4. Test basic navigation by clicking buttons, scrolling, and observing what happens
5. Identify all clickable buttons, input fields, and scrollable areas
6. Focus on breadth, not depth - stay at surface level (2-3 taps maximum per area)
7. Explore for at least 40-60 interactions to ensure comprehensive coverage

COMPLETION CRITERIA - Only call complete() when you have:
✓ Opened the app successfully
✓ Visited at least 4-5 main screens/tabs
✓ Documented navigation paths for each area
✓ Identified interactive elements (buttons, inputs, scrollable areas)

When you have explored thoroughly, call complete(success=True, reason="...") where the reason parameter contains a comprehensive markdown-formatted report with:

# {app_name} - Stage 1: Basic Exploration

## App Launch
[Describe what happened when opening the app - permissions, splash screen, initial view]

## Screen Inventory
[List all main screens/tabs you visited with bullet points]

## Navigation Structure
[Explain how to reach each screen - e.g., "Profile: Bottom tab, 4th icon from left"]

## Interactive Elements
[List buttons, input fields, scrollable areas discovered]

## First Experience Observations
[Note what you observed about the initial user experience]

## Issues Noticed
[Any bugs, confusing UI, or problems encountered]

Do NOT complete early. Explore for at least 40-60 interactions before calling complete().
